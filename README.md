# ðŸ§± Block Sculptor
### Sculpt your imagination in cubes.

**Block Sculptor** is a 3D magnetic voxel sandbox built in **Three.js**, where you can sculpt, snap, and shape cube-based creations.

Build your own digital room, save it as a shareable file, and bring your ideas to life in a living 3D space.

**Phase 1** includes the room-size selector and base 3D environment.
